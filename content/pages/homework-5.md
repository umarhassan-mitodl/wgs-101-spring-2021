***Ida B. Wells: Passion for Justice*** **(William Greaves, 1989)**

Answer #2 and #3 (a few paragraphs each). (We’ll also discuss #1, but it’s not necessary to write about it.)

1. Many contemporary documentaries about women either omit voice-over narration or use a female voice-over. Why do you think filmmaker William Greaves chose a male voice-over (in addition to having novelist Toni Morrison read from Wells’s diary)?
2. In this film, the late acclaimed novelist Toni Morrison (*Beloved*) reads from Wells’s diary. Rather than simply using Morrison as a voice-over, the filmmaker includes Morrison as a powerful visual presence. What, in your view, is the intended effect on audiences of Morrison reading Wells? Why do you think this director chose Morrison rather than another writer, actor or political leader? How does Morrison’s presence  
    connect with the male voice-over? If you were making this film today, what actors or activists might you have cast in the role of diary reader(s)? How might this film have been different if Wells’s diary had been read by a different or less well-known writer, actor or activist (or more than one person)?
3. How does the life of Wells influence our ongoing discussion about the intersection of race, class and gender in the lives of past and present African-American female activists (such as Sojourner Truth, Anna Julia Cooper and other female activists of color)? How does Wells’s life of political engagement influence our thinking about gender-conscious political strategies and women’s rights activity/feminism?
