#### Three Major Writing Assignments

Each student will be responsible for submitting three major writing assignments during the semester. Each essay should be typed, double-spaced, Times New Roman 12-point font with one-inch margins; one page equals 250 words. Major assignment prompts will be distributed at least two weeks prior to due dates. Each essay should demonstrate understanding of key concepts in the course by framing a clear argument in response to the question and supporting that argument with specific examples and quotations from relevant course readings. The first essay,  
a comparative rhetorical analysis of primary historical texts, should be about 4–5 pages (1000-1250 words) in first version and 6–7 pages (1500–1750 words) in revision.

The next two major assignments will be 6–7 pages, 1500–1750 words) each. The second essay offers the choice of a comparative analysis of classic literary and political texts or a case study of an individual analyzed within the framework of gender socialization literature. The third major assignment asks students to write an informational/educational narrative for a museum exhibit on historical and contemporary dimensions of gender, work and family, drawing explicitly upon secondary sources; the print text is supplemented by an exhibit of visual sources such as photographs, charts, graphs, maps, art work, film clips, etc.
