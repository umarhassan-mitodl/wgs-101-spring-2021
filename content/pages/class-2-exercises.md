#### Explaining the Emergence of Movements for Women's Rights and Gender Equality

     Women’s and gender studies, as an academic field, has its roots in the emergence of social movements for women’s and gender equality. However, the emergence of a social movement, such as the U.S. women’s rights movement in both its first (1848-1920) and second + waves (1966 -  ), is often a puzzle for historians and social scientists to explain.  
     Why do social movements for women’s and gender equality emerge at particular points in time as the initial American women’s rights movement (“first wave”) did in the late 1840s or the reborn movement (“second wave”) did in the mid-1960s?  What are some social/historical (and individual) experiences/factors that motivate people to form, identify with and join women’s rights/gender equality movements?   
      Try to name at least FIVE such experiences or factors.  If you see one or two as the most important, indicate with \*.
