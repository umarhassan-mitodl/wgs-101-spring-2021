***The Yellow Wallpaper*** **(1892) - Charlotte Perkins Gilman**

Write about question 1, 5 and another question of your choice. All three questions (together) should be a page to a page and a half, typed, double-spaced.

1. What connections do you see between Rosenberg’s article (“Hysterical Woman…”) and Gilman’s fictional story/novella?
2. What are the possible meanings of the title and the color of the wallpaper? Why did Gilman use first person narration? Why is the female protagonist unnamed throughout the text?
3. How would you describe the narrator’s voice in this story? How does that voice evolve from the beginning to the end of the novella? How does the fragmented style of the narrative reveal the personality and character of the narrator?
4. How does Gilman engage with traditional ideas of nineteenth century American femininity (e.g., the “cult of true womanhood”) and masculinity in this story? What do the house and wallpaper symbolize? What does the woman/women in the wallpaper represent
5. How do you interpret the meaning of the last scene? Has the narrator, through her madness, liberated herself as an individual from the control of her husband/male dominated medical establishment, or has she experienced the ultimate victimization? Are there other interpretations that come to mind for you?
6. Gilman was very much an activist writer and authored texts in many different genres and voices (the social scientist, the journalist, the utopian author, the Gothic writer). What is she advocating in this story? What are the risks of this narrative strategy for a politically-oriented writer who fights for women’s rights, including suffrage?
7. What contemporary issues does The Yellow Wallpaper evoke? Why do you think it has become one of the most commonly assigned readings in college courses in different disciplines such as literature, creative writing, history, American studies, women’s and gender studies, sociology, psychology and the history of medicine?
