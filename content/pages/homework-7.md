**Questions on** ***The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter*** **and** ***The Feminine Mystique***

Write about at least questions 1, 3, and 5 (about 1–1.5 pages). We will discuss these questions in class. 

1. Why do you think that the filmmaker (Connie Field) selected these five women to tell the story of U.S. female defense workers during World War II? How does the style of this film (e.g., lack of narrative voice-over) compare to that of *Ida B Wells: Passion for Justice*?
2. How did the needs of the U.S. defense economy during World War II contribute to questioning biological essentialist arguments about “woman’s place” and the nature of masculinity and femininity? What film scenes (describe at least two) express this sense of questioning?
3. What is the effect of viewing the contrast (describe at least one scene) between the U.S. government propaganda and the five women’s lives? How does the filmmaker use voice-over?
4. How does the postwar conservative shift in gender roles after 1945 affect these five women? What does the film present as the meaning(s) of their World War II experience? How does the music contribute to the overall meaning of the film?
5. What connections do you make between Friedan’s first chapter of *The Feminine Mystique* (“The Problem that Has No Name”) and the film?
