#### Creating Television: Thinking about TV and Gender from the Production Side

Assume that you have received financing to produce a new fictional television series in which (a) a female character (or characters) of various races/ethnicities would play a leading role(s) and/or (b) major characters would also be members of the LGBTQ+ community and/or actively question or transcend the gender binary. 

1. What genre would you choose to work in? (e.g., comedy (workplace, family), drama –e.g., historical, detective, medical, sci-fi/fantasy, other)? Why did you select this genre? Where would you want to place this series (e.g., major network, cable network, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.)
2. Take five minutes to write down the first ideas that come to your mind for this series.
