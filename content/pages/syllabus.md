#### Course Description

This course offers an introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies, an interdisciplinary academic field that explores critical questions about the meaning of gender in society. The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students with key issues, questions and debates in Women’s and Gender Studies scholarship, both historical and contemporary. Gender scholarship critically analyzes themes of gendered performance and power in a wide range of social spheres, such as law, politics, media, education, work, medicine, social policy, and the family. Throughout the semester, we will question gender in multiple ways: Why has gender been a primary organizing principle of society? How do gendered scripts for dress, appearance, and behavior emerge among various social groups and in different societies and historical periods? How do we explain the sexual division of labor and the unequal social status of women and girls and those activities, behaviors, and roles deemed “feminine” in society? In what ways does gender intersect with race, class, ethnicity, age, and sexuality? How do gendered structures of power and authority operate? What factors contribute to the formation and success of movements for and against gender equality and fluidity? Can we imagine a future in which we largely ignore gender or envision gender and sexuality in more expansive, fluid, and egalitarian ways?

This term you will become acquainted with many of the critical questions and concepts feminist scholars have developed as tools for thinking about gendered experience. In addition, we will    
explore the complex and changing ways in which gender intersects with class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and age within various spheres and institutions of society. Required readings include classic and contemporary women’s and gender studies texts, representing scholarship from a variety of disciplines, as well as political documents, and personal narratives of gendered lives. Course topics include: the first and subsequent waves of American women’s/gender rights activism and gender issues in relation to the law, politics, socialization, education, media, work, health and reproduction, sexuality, families, and globalization. Through successfully completing this course, students will be better prepared to participate in and contribute effectively to larger contemporary public conversations about the meaning of gender in society, to apply the critical tools of women’s and gender studies in their academic, personal, civic, and occupational lives, and to succeed in more advanced classes in this field.

#### Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Understand and engage with central debates in the field of Women's and Gender Studies;
- Define and apply basic terms and concepts central to this field;
- Employ a variety of methods of analyzing gender in society; drawing upon both primary and secondary sources;
- Apply concepts and theories of Women's and Gender Studies to life experiences and historical and contemporary events and processes;
- Communicate effectively about gender issues in both writing and speech, drawing upon Women's and Gender Studies scholarship and addressing a public audience.

#### Required Readings

- Perkins Gilman, Charlotte. "[The Yellow Wallpaper](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Yellow_Wall_Paper)." The New England Magazine, 1892.

#### Evaluation and Grading

This course is considered [Communications-Intensive](https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/communication-requirement). By the end of the term, students will have written at least 5,000 words divided among 3–5 assignments. At least one major assignment should be revised and resubmitted. Students are also assessed in the area of oral communication (discussion, class participation, and oral presentations). 

Student performance in the class is evaluated as follows:

- Attendance, participation, and short homework exercises (15%)
- Current event analysis oral presentation and write-up (2–3 pages) (15%);
- Three major writing assignments (70%).

#### Writing Objectives

Throughout the semester, I will encourage student writers to:

- Address an intelligent, public audience in a graceful style, providing key information necessary to understand an argument; 
- Develop ideas in an interesting, original, and coherent manner;
- Formulate an organizing idea, thesis, or mapping statement;
- Support arguments with appropriate evidence, and use and cite sources thoughtfully and correctly; 
- Employ clear, concise language that uses the conversations of English grammar, punctuation, word usage, and source citation; and
- Structure arguments carefully with clear introductions, transitions, middles, and conclusions.

#### Attendance/Participation/Homework Assignments/Classroom Community 

To foster a sense of intellectual community, this course is structured in a synchronous online format that blends lecture and discussion. It is crucial that students come to class on time, with required texts, well-prepared to offer thoughtful responses to the assigned readings. To be effective as class participants, students need to complete reading and writing tasks by the assigned dates. A vital, ongoing intellectual conversation—which actively questions the meaning of gender in society—is at the heart of the course. **Many issues that we address**  
**in the course are controversial and students may have or voice very different viewpoints. It is critical that we acknowledge and respect one another’s experiences and perspectives so that our online classroom is a safe and supportive space to converse productively across our differences.**

Since our class functions as an intellectual community, it is essential that students attend class faithfully. To support our mission as a face-to-face online community, please keep your cameras on and turn off competing electronic devices (such as cellphones). Let me know as soon as possible if you are experiencing any technical difficulty.

More than two absences may affect the final grade; a student cannot pass the course with over five absences. Three latenesses—or  
early departures—count as an absence. If a student must miss class or cannot submit an assignment on time due to a personal or medical emergency, that student should email me (or have a dean contact me) as soon as possible. Major assignments and lecture handouts will be posted on the website by the day after the class in which they were reviewed. Active participation in both large and small group discussion is necessary to receive full credit for the attendance and participation component of the final grade (15%). Homework assignments also count for part of this grade.
