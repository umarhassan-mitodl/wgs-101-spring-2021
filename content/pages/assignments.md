The first version of Essay #1 is commented on and letter-graded by the instructor. The revision of Essay #1 will also be letter-graded; the revision letter grade will count twice that of the first version. The second and third essays (which do not entail    
revision) are also letter-graded. There is no final exam in the course; the third and final major assignment is due over email by the end of the last day of the semester.
