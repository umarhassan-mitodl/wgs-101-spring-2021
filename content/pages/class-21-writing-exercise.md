#### "Love and Gold - Arlie Russell Hochschild

Write for about five minutes in response to these quotations from this essay; use bullet points to generate as many ideas as possible. 

1. “The notion of extracting resources from the Third World harkens back to imperialism in its most literal form: the nineteenth century extraction of gold, ivory and rubber from the Third World….Today, as love and care become the “new gold”, the female part of the story has grown in prominence. In both cases, through the death or displacement of their parents, Third World children pay the price.”
2. "But if First World middle-class women are building careers that are molded according to the old male model, by putting in long hours at demanding jobs, their nannies and other domestic workers suffer a greatly exaggerated version of the same thing. Two women working for pay is not a bad idea. But two working mothers giving their all to work is a good idea gone haywire. In the end, both First and Third World women are small players in a larger economic game whose rules they have not written.”
