#### Gender, the Weight of History and the Surname Question: The Meaning of Naming Choices in Marriage

Write for five minutes on a blank sheet of paper. Use bullet points. 

 **“A wife should no more take her husband’s name than he should hers. My name is my identity and must not be lost.” – Lucy Stone**

Respond to the above quote. Do you agree or disagree with Lucy Stone? Are you unclear, confused or conflicted in your position?

Some possible questions to consider:

1\. Today, in 2021, if a woman marrying a man is committed to gender equality in marriage and society, should she retain her birth name?  
 What’s typically at stake for her in changing her last name to her husband’s, keeping her birth name, hyphenating names, or creating a new surname for the couple?  How important is the question of marital name change?

2\. If a man marrying a woman believes in gender equality in marriage, should he opt for alternative naming practices, such as each partner keeping his/her birth name, taking his wife’s last name as his own, hyphenating his name with his spouse’s or creating a new surname for the couple? What’s at stake for him?  

3\. In a same-sex marriage or a marriage with at least one nonbinary spouse, what are your thoughts about the naming question?

4\. How have your experience(s) growing up, living in, or travelling to other cultures/countries influenced your thoughts on the naming question?
