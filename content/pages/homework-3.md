**Frederick Douglass "Why I Became a 'Woman's Right's' Man" (1892)**

*Which of Douglass' arguments, represented in the quotes below, do you find the most and least convincing? Why? (About a page in length)*

“When the true history of the anti-slavery cause shall be written, women will occupy a large space in its pages; for the cause of the slave has been peculiarly woman’s cause.”

“If intelligence is the only true and rational basis of government, it follows that that is the best government which draws its life and power from the largest sources of wisdom, energy and goodness at its command”

“Nations have been and still are but armed camps, expending their wealth and strength and ingenuity in forging weapons of destruction…and while it may not be contended that the introduction of the feminine element in government would entirely cure this tendency to exalt might over right, many reasons can be given to show that woman’s influence would greatly tend to check and modify this barbarous and destructive tendency.”

“If from the cradle through life the outside world brands a class as unfit for this or that work, the character of the class will come to resemble and conform to the character described.”

**Susan B. Anthony "Speech After Being Convicted of Voting..." (1873)**

Select three memorable quotations from Anthony’s speech, delivered after she was convicted of “civil disobedience voting” in the 1872 U.S. election. How do these quotations support her central argument that U.S. women should have the right to vote? (about ½ pg.)
