***Miss Representation*** **(Jennifer Siebel Newsom, 2012): Issues of Gendered Representation and Omission**

1\. What does the filmmaker assume about the impact of advertising, esp. fashion and beauty advertising, upon girls and women? To what extent do you agree?  
2\. A central perspective of the film also focuses on omission: “you can’t be what you can’t see” (Marian Wright Edelman) How does the filmmaker support this point? What pathways to change does she suggest? To what extent do you agree with the film’s perspective on the  
power of the media to impact female voice and representation in a range of spheres, including politics?  
3\. What are your reactions to the Gillette ad? Before the current wave of alternative advertising, the message of the ad was usually conveyed by  
activists like Jackson Katz and writers like Michael Kimmel. What does it mean for you that this message is being presented in a commercial space?
