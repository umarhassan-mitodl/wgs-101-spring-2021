#### Class #1 In-Class 

#### Exercise 1

Write for about five minutes on a blank sheet of paper; use “bullet points” to express ideas more quickly.  After completing this exercise, you will pair up for about ten minutes with a classmate and discuss your answers to these questions together. Then, you will introduce your discussion partner to the class and the issues or questions that are most important to that student.

1. What women's and gender issues interest you most?
2. Name one or two questions that intrigue you about gender or the role/status/experience of women?

#### Exercise 2

The Debate over Gender Representation on the MIT Seal

Write for about ten minutes on blank sheet of paper. 

Background 

The MIT seal, with the Latin inscription “Mens et Manus” (“Mind and Hand”) was first adopted on December 26,1864. (MIT opened in 1865 with no female students.) The seal design was approved in 1863 by The Committee on the Seal (President William B. Rogers and Institute Treasurer Charles Dalton). The committee minutes only indicate that they chose a seal; the deliberations around the seal’s design were not recorded.

The seal highlights 1861, the year MIT was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The seal pictures a scholar with a book and a laborer with an anvil; both appear to be male. The seal symbolizes MIT’s ideal of cooperation between knowledge and research and the mechanical or manual arts. Many see the seal as signifying the ideal of the practical application of knowledge. The seal was modernized during MIT President Howard Johnson’s administration (1966-71), but the figures remained male. The presence of these two male figures on the seal has generated some controversy for almost 20 years.

 A student diversity rally in spring 2001 called for a new seal representing both males and females. The Brass Rat, the MIT ring, has sometimes, in recent years (e.g., class of 2017), featured a female on the seal shank; students have been divided in opinion about the change. The seal remains a point of contention within MIT. Only the Board of Trustees (“The Corporation”) can officially change the MIT seal, which appears on diplomas, certificates and other Institute documents. Within the last ten years at MIT, we have had the first female President (Susan Hockfield) and the Institute celebrated its 150th anniversary.  The class of 2024 is 49% female and 51% male (MIT Admissions).
