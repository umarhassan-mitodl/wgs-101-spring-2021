**Defining “feminist” and “feminism”: the language of the Second Wave**

1. How would you define the current terms “feminism” and “feminist”?      
2. What connotations, images, or associations do the words “feminism” and “feminist” have today (and in the past)?
3. Do you see the language of “feminism”, as compared with “women’s rights”, more suited to the Second Wave?  In what ways does the approach of Friedan’s *The Feminine Mystique* and the 1966 NOW “Statement of Purpose” connect with the language of feminism?
