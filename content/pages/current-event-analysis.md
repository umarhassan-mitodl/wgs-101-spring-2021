#### Current Event Analysis: Oral Presentation in Pairs

Each student, as part of a two-person team, will give one oral presentation, an analysis of a current event related to class readings and lectures/discussions of a particular week. Students will work in pairs to research and present an interpretation of a current event news article of their choice pertaining to the weekâ€™s topic. Your task is to make connections between concepts presented in an assigned reading(s) and lectures/films and a contemporary example in the news. This assignment requires close reading of the news item you choose, presenting  
your analysis in a coherent way to the class, along with several follow-up discussion questions. Sign up for presentation dates will begin in the second week of class. Students should plan to consult the instructor as they choose current events topics to research. Oral presentations should be about 15 minutes. A typed presentation plan or outline is due over email a week before the presentation. A short write-up of the presentation (and joint evaluation), accompanied by any visuals (e.g., PowerPoint or Prezi slides), will be due over email a week after the  
presentation; each student pair will also receive a joint letter-grade and written evaluation of their oral presentation. Students are encouraged to read a major newspaper regularly to increase their awareness of media representations of contemporary gender issues.
