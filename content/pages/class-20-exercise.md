In-Class Writing Exercises and Discussion Questions 

#### Jodi Kantor: "Harvard Business School Case: Gender Equity"

1. Was this process (2011-2013) a much-needed reform or an overextension of the authority of the HBS administration?
2. After reading about this case, how did you react to different elements of this experiment, such as:

\* Observing all classes of female faculty  
\*Implementing a group project learning model and avoiding “cold-calling” in class  
\*Making rules about student dress and out-of-class time socializing

How do you react to students who claimed that their privacy rights  
were violated by the HBS administration?

     3. Would you support a program like this at MIT?
